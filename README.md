# Hepatitis E virus sequence diversity
This is a repository for the current and past status of the HEV sequence related data we use at INNT-FLI.
Part of these data have been published ([see the release tab](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/HEV/releases)), 
and other is in preparation for publication. Please, refer to those publication for an overview of the organization of the data. 

The goal of this repository is to serve as a backup and source of supplemetary data associated with publiched 
papers and conferences.

We also hope that this site could generate some feedback from others authors which would want to see their original data inserted or corrected. Please use the ["issues"](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/HEV/issues) here, our e-mail or any other way at your convenience.

We also shown here the development process of the tools for automation of the processing of the data. This include:
+ The alignment
+ The excel worksheet, and the related VBA code.
+ A python script for automation of the update with new sequences.

We also aim to use the associated [Wiki](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/HEV/wiki) to comment about how to use those tools.
