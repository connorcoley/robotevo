# Hepatitis E virus sequence diversity
This is a repository for the current and past status of the HEV sequence related data we use at INNT-FLI.
Part of these data have been published ([see the release tab](https://github.com/qPCR4vir/HEV/releases)), 
and other is in preparation for publication.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a backup and source of supplemetary data associated with publiched 
papers and conferences.
