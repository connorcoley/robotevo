Welcome to RobotEvo
====================================

RobotEvo generates Freedom EVOware scripts for the Freedom EVO universal pipetting robot from TECAN.
It provides new layers of abstraction to offer a higher level programing model that allows a more direct
programing of the steps needed in a typical biochemical/biological pipetting protocol like RNA extraction.
