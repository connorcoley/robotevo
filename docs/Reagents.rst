`Reagent` - a fundamental concept
=================================

A `Reagent` is a fundamental concept in RobotEvo programming. It makes possible to define a protocol in a natural way, matching what a normal laboratory's protocol indicates.
Defines a named homogeneous liquid solution, the wells it occupy, the initial amount needed to run the protocol (auto calculated), and how much is needed per sample, if applicable. It is also used to define samples, intermediate reactions and products. It makes possible a robust tracking of all actions and a logical error detection, while significantly simplifying the  programming of non trivial protocols.
